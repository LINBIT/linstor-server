# Linstor Server

This repository contains the user space server part of linstor to ease DRBD9 resource management.

Linstor, developed by [LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com), is a software that manages DRBD replicated
LVM/ZFS volumes across a group of machines. It maintains DRBD configuration on the participating machines.  It
creates/deletes the backing LVM/ZFS volumes. It automatically places the backing LVM/ZFS volumes among the
participating machines.

# Using Linstor

# Releases
Releases generated by git tags on github are snapshots of the git repository at the given time. You most
likely do not want to use these. They might lack things such as generated man pages, the `configure` script,
and other generated files. If you want to build from a tarball, use the ones [provided by us](https://www.linbit.com/en/drbd-community/drbd-download/).
